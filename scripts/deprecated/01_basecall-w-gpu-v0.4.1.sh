# guppy_basecall_server is no longer in use. The guppy_basecaller option --port 9999 is no longer used.

# This script runs guppy_basecaller via port 9999 on guppy_basecall_server that 
# should be continously running on node98. Either fast or high-accuracy mode
# can be used. Guppy will produce demultiplexed, trimmed, and compressed fastqs.

# UGE options removed, since this must be performed manually on node 98
# May eventually be added, if GPUs (Tesla V100s) are available via UGE/qsub

#This function will check to make sure the directory doesn't already exist before trying to create it
